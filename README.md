## CSS & JS

The CSS file is generated from SCSS files. See `SCSS` directory for source files.
The Javascript source file is located in the `js` directory.

All CSS and Javascript files are compiled and minified to one file. Therefore we only have one http request per script language, which gives us a major performance boost. Javascript files are transpiled as well to decrease file size.

- js/min/app-min.js
- css/min/app-min.css
